	<strong>Diversity enriches, exclusion harms</strong>. Ever since grade school I have been enlightened by friendships with people quite different from myself. In sixth grade I developed a camaraderie with a student posessing a severe learning disability. His name was Jeff. The other students teased Jeff ruthlessly, and I felt a compelling need to protect him, or at least comfort him. Jeff and I enjoyed the same activities as anyone else, but Jeff was slow. He couldn't understand the rules of board games, for example. Jeff preferred bicycling. Jeff was absolutely shunned by the students at school. When Jeff and I were hung out, it was just the two of us. I saw up close how isolated and lonely he was. I learned a valuable lesson on how cruel social cliques can be. 
	
	<p>My grade school was almost 100% white. There was only one black kid, Glenn, and he only attended my school for one year. Glenn invited me to his birthday party. I showed up on time, but when I arrived no one except Glenn and his mom were there. While we waited for more people to arrive Glenn and I hung out listening to music, but I did not know any of the songs. I figured Glenn invited everyone from school, but no one I knew ever showed up. I don't know if the other kids from school stood him up, or if Glenn just never invited them. I was the only white person at the party. Everyone else was black. Glenn said the other guests were people he knew from his prior school. I remember we all played musical chairs. Some kids would push each other off the chairs, and the parents didn't do anything! There was absolutely no hostility. The pushing was part of the fun. I learned that in Glenn's house a lot of little rules could be bent. Even today I sometimes recall that experience when I encounter people of different cultures. I wonder which rules are strict, and which are bendable. </p>
	
	<p>More recently, a deaf fellow, Wesley, joined a fellowship to which I belong. When he first joined we communicated using simple gestures and quick written notes, but it's hard to build up a friendship that way. So I decided to take sign language classes. Now Wesley and I can communicate much more effectively. I can even translate for him when we are with other hearing people. And we can hang out together in groups of all deaf people. This friendship has opened my eyes to the challenges faced by deaf people, but more importantly to deaf culture. Have you ever been in a gymnasium sized room full of deaf people waving their arms about? Well, let me tell you, it's something to behold! </p>

	<strong>I promote inclusion</strong>. I work actively to ensure open and welcoming personal and professional associations.  Examples:
	
	<p><strong>I am a certified <a href="http://www.svsu.edu/diversity/professionaldevelopment/inclusionadvocacy/" target="_blank">Inclusion Advocate</a> at Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU)</strong>. Inclusion Advocates can broaden search and screening processes for new hires by encouraging alternative perspectives regarding job applicants. I have served on two faculty search committees as Inclusion Advocate. </p>

	<p><strong>I founded a diverse group of graduate student researchers</strong>. At Oakland University (OU) international and domestic students tended to socialize separately. I started <a href="https://gradconnection.weebly.com">Grad Connection</a>, a graduate student group designed to foster scholarship, stewardship and fellowship. I organized events from conferences to cookouts so international and domestic students could socialize together. This resulted in additional scholarly research collaboration between international and domestic graduate students in the research lab. More importantly, it was fun.</p>

	<p><strong>I joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NSBEOaklandUniversity/photos/rpp.519078188115750/762448563778710/?type=3&theater">campus chapter</a> of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)</strong>. I was already friends with NSBE's president and several NSBE members so this was a natural fit, even though I'm not black. I participated in several outreach initiatives to encourage more diverse applications for admission.</p>

	<strong>I welcome new opportunities to expand my social connections</strong>. My wife and I belong to a Korean church. I belong to a social group where some members are deaf or hard-of-hearing, and we communicate using American Sign Language. I do not seek out diverse social groups, but I join them when opportunities arise.
